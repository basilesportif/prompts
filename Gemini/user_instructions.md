## Base Instructions

## Implementation Plan Creation Instructions
Please create a detailed implementation plan as a file called `plans/IMPL_PLAN.md`. It will be ingested by an LLM to guide the code generation. The LLM is good at following plans and writing code, when given a plan with clear instructions.

Your plan should be structured as follows:
1. Concise description of the feature you are implementing

2. Clear instructions that the LLM should: ONLY DO THIS PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

3. List of files to edit/create/delete. For each file, specify:
  - file operation (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - file path (relative to the project directory)
  - feature specification (what functionality to add/change/remove)
  - pseudocode or real code that is helpful for implementing


Here is the feature to implement:
